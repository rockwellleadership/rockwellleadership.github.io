## Jennifer Rockwell

Prior to creating Rockwell Leadership Solutions, Jennifer worked as a Human
Resources business partner for PepsiCo for 13 years.  Her roles and geographies
increased in scope until she became a Sr. Director supporting the national
marketing and commercial organizations.  She made a commitment in 2018 to engage
in work that would support organizational, cultural and leadership growth for
herself and other professionals.  In 2021, she became an affiliate with [Stop At
Nothing][san] where she is a facilitator, interviewer and consultant.

##### Professional

Jennifer is a professionally trained coach through George Mason Universityâ€™s
Center for the Advancement of Well-Being.  She specializes in executive
coaching, talent management and development, change management and employee
engagement.  Her personal and professional interests of leadership
transformation and continuous learning motivated her to create Rockwell
Leadership Solutions and leads her to help others change and grow both
personally and professionally.

##### Education

Jennifer holds a Master of Science degree in Human Resources and Industrial
Relations from West Virginia University and a certificate of Coaching for
Leadership and Organizational Wellbeing from George Mason University.  She is
certified to administer Myers-Briggs Type Indicator diagnostic and the Hogan
personality index, both of which complement her coaching practice.

##### A Mountaineer

When she is not coaching and consulting, she dedicates a portion of her time as
a member and former chair of the Legacy Council for the MSHRM program at WVU,
where her and her husband fund a student scholarship.  As a proud Mountaineer,
she is grateful for the opportunity to give back to the program while supporting
deeply held values of education and charitable giving.
